Custom component for easy use of a Pixoo64 within Home Assistant. With this integration you have the possibility to display different designs and personalize them with information from the Home Assistant. For example, you can use this integration to display several texts {{ templates }} and images on one page. You can also use this integration to determine how long you want to see a page, e.g. you can set the page to change every 15 seconds. In addition, you also have a light entity with which you can switch the display on and off time-controlled. Last but not least, you can create automations with which you can display text and images as a push using certain triggers.

## Installation
1. Install this integration with HACS (adding repository required), or copy the contents of this
repository into the `custom_components/pixoo-homeassistant` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

Now edit your configuration.yaml


### configuration.yaml example:
 Just a small example with the HA logo and the current time!

### Automation Example

You can use it for Push Notifications.
```

  - platform: YOUR PLATFORM
    e.g. entity_id: YOUR ENTITY
action:
  - service: divoom_pixoo.show_message
    data:
      entity_id: sensor.divoom_pixoo
      #If you want draw more than 1 Message u have to need more positions, colors and fonts too
      messages: ["Message 1", "Message 2"] 
      positions: [[1, 1], [1, 20]]
      colors: [[255, 0, 0], [0, 255, 0]]
      fonts: ["FONT_GICKO", "FONT_PICO_8"]
      #same as Messages at images u need for each image an image_positions
      images : ["/config/custom_components/divoom_pixoo/img/sunpower.png",
                "/config/custom_components/divoom_pixoo/img/haus.png"]
      image_positions : [[1, 30],
                          [20, 30]]
```

## Issues

Sometimes the display crashes, especially with animated images. I have often read on the Internet that this is due to the power supply being too weak or the brightness being too high. I now have the display permanently set to **90%** and it no longer crashes.
